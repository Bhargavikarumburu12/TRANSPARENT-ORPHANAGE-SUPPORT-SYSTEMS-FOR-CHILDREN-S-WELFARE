Abstract:
Our project aims to address the inefficiencies in existing orphanage 
support systems by implementing a transparent monitoring system. 
by integrating with government-funded healthcare initiatives, we ensure 
that orphanages receive necessary funds for the specialized care of 
children with congenital diseases or disabilities. Unlike traditional 
donation platforms, our solution ensures accountability by directly
linking donations to verified product purchases, facilitated through 
government-authorized channels. By leveraging this mechanism, donors 
can track the utilization of their contributions, ensuring that funds 
are allocated efficiently and effectively, ultimately guaranteeing 
that orphaned children receive essential goods and services as intended.
